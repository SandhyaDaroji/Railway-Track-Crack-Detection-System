# Railway-Track-Crack-Detection-System
A railway track crack and obstacle detection system using ESP32-CAM, Arduino Uno, and YOLO-based computer vision. The system performs real-time monitoring, automatically stops the inspection vehicle on fault detection, and displays results on a web dashboard to improve railway safety and reduce manual inspection.
